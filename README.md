#Payment form

Back-end + front end:

You can run the JAR, and the application will run a service on localhost:8075.
There are some endpoints I have not implemented in the front-end, but you can try them out using the added postman collection
form.postman_collection.json.

Swagger is located at localhost:8075/documentation

Main TODOS - full test coverage, refactor front-end to typescript and actually spend time on it (and tests).
Then docker-ize this.
